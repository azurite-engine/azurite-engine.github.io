          <h1>Contributing to Azurite</h1>
          <p>We want to make contributing to this project as easy as possible for everyone. We love community contributions, after
            all, this is a community built game engine. Whether you are opening a pull request, or submitting an issue, we ask
            that you please follow these guidelines in order for your contributions to be&nbsp;easily incorporated into the
            engine.</p>
          <h3><a id="user-content-we-develop-with-github-trello-and-discord" class="anchor"
              href="https://github.com/Games-With-Gabe-Community/Azurite/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#we-develop-with-github-trello-and-discord"></a>We
            Develop with Github, Trello, and Discord</h3>
          <p>We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. We use Trello to
            track development tasks. We use Discord for communication.</p>

            Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests</h3>
          <p>Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (check out this&nbsp;<a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-O8ZNW9icQ&amp;feature=emb_logo">YouTube Video</a>&nbsp;about git if you
            aren't familiar).</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Fork the repo and create your branch from&nbsp;<code>main</code>.</li>
            <li>If you've changed classes, fields, and/or methods, update the JavaDocs.</li>
            <li>Document all code that you write using javadocs, including class descriptions, all fields and methods that aren't
              100% self explanatory.</li>
            <li>Create a new pull request, and wait for the project maintainers to review it.&nbsp;</li>
          </ol>
          <p><em>If you plan on making large changes to the engine, please consult with the project maintainers to make sure that
              it is a change we will be willing to work with you on.</em></p>
          <h3>Use a Consistent Coding Style</h3>
          <p>Please follow the&nbsp;<a href="azurite-style.html" rel="nofollow">Azurite Java Style
              Guide</a>&nbsp;when styling all of your code. It is important to keep the style consistent across the codebase so
            that other contributors can read your code.</p>
          <h3>Contribution Criteria</h3>
          <p>When reviewing a pull request, we look for one or more of these criteria to be met.&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Does the PR resolve a problem or defficiency in the engine?</li>
            <li>Does the PR add a meaningful new feature?</li>
            <li>Does the PR modify in a helpful way existing code as to make it simpler to use?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We also look for one these criteria to be met.&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is the code relatively straight forward to make use of without prior knowledge?</li>
            <li>Does the code follow the Azurite style guide?</li>
            <li>Is the code properly documented?</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>How to format a pull request</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Write a description of the most important changes you have made, and of things you have added.</li>
            <li>Include a basic use case of your&nbsp;code inside of an empty scene class if applicable (please comment if
              necessary, this will be added to the documentation site).</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License</h3>
          <p>In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same&nbsp;<a
              href="https://github.com/Games-With-Gabe-Community/Azurite/blob/main/LICENSE">MIT License</a>&nbsp;that covers the
            project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.</p>
